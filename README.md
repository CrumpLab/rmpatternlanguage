Example website hosts through this repos github pages option:

This bookdown theme was written by Matt Crump. It is inspired by the book, "A PATTERN LANGUAGE", by Christopher Alexander, Sara Ishikawa, Murray Silverstein, also Max Jacobson, Ingrid Fiksdahl-King, and Shlomo Angel.

This is indeed an interesting book, worth reading to see a great example of a pattern language. Google pattern language and you can learn more about what it is, and how to make one. This is a theme to make your pattern language  in the same visual style and format as the original book.

This is a minimal reproducible example, fork this repo, then compile in R-Studio with the bookdown package. The formatting should be set-up to work, if you follow the templates in each chapter. Have fun!
