USING PATTERNS Inspired by “A PATTERN LANGUAGE” ADDITIONAL INFORMATION This bookdown theme was written by Matt Crump. It is inspired by the book, “A PATTERN LANGUAGE”, by Christopher Alexander, Sara Ishikawa, Murray Silverstein, also Max Jacobson, Ingrid Fiksdahl-King, and Shlomo Angel. This is indeed an interesting book, worth reading to see a great example of a pattern language. Google pattern language and you can learn more about what it is, and how to make one. This is a theme to make your pattern language in the same visual style and format as the original book. For the repo here https://github.com/CrumpLab/rmpatternlanguage. This is a minimal reproducible example. The formatting should be set-up to work, if you follow the templates in each chapter. Have fun! "],
